# Probabilistic Integrated Gas and Electricity Network Model (P-IGEN)

P-IGEN is a probabilistic model for integrated gas and electricity networks considering the input uncertainty associated with gas demand, electricity demand and wind generation. First, the correlated uncertainty of electricity and gas demand are modelled using the copula method, while wind generation uncertainty is modelled using kernel density estimation. Then, the optimisation problem is formulated as an interdependent steady-state optimal power and natural gas flow, which is iterated using the non-sequential Monte Carlo method to capture the input uncertainty. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated through the assessment of heat electrification impacts on Great Britainâ€™s electricity and gas networks. While the case study is based on Great Britain, the modelling framework can be applied to other networks. The use of P-IGEN model requires familiarity with basic operations of MATLAB.
